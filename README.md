# 🚀 Embedded Systems Portfolio – Ahmet Emin Yakar

Welcome to my personal repository for C and Embedded Systems development.

This repo documents my hands-on journey in mastering core embedded engineering concepts through modular, testable, and scalable systems. Projects are built using low-level C, Arduino environments, UART interfaces, and embedded control logic.

Each project focuses on solving real-world control problems using efficient code architecture and system thinking.

## 🛠️ Core Skills Demonstrated

- Procedural C programming (input, output, conditionals, functions)
- Embedded logic systems (FSMs, state-based control)
- Multi-sensor data classification
- Fault detection and system failure analysis
- Arduino and microcontroller programming
- UART and Serial Communication
- Input validation and fault handling
- Modular project architecture and documentation
- GitHub version control and Git CLI workflow

## 📌 Project Approach

Each system is designed with:
- **Single-responsibility logic blocks**
- **Readable and maintainable C**
- **Inline comments and function-based design**
- **README.md with explanation of logic and thresholds**

Projects can be compiled using `gcc` or uploaded via Arduino IDE, depending on platform.

## 🧠 Learning Framework

This repository is part of a focused learning model to:
- Build from scratch (not copy)
- Understand code flow and memory logic
- Apply C to real embedded challenges
- Document and structure like a professional engineer
