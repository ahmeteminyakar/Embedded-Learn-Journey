# Embedded-Learn-Journey

📅 April 14 – May 24, 2025

This repository is a complete archive of my 41-day Embedded Systems and IoT development journey.  
The focus areas include Python, Embedded C, UART communication, FSM logic, sensor integration, GUI dashboards, and MQTT-based IoT systems using ESP32.

## 🧠 Daily Log
- ✅ Day 1: Python Introduction – `print()`, `input()`, data types  
- ✅ Day 2: Advanced Conditional Statements – comparison logic with 3-number input

## 💻 Projects

### 📄 Day1_PythonBasics.py
- Prints user input, basic type conversion
- Used: `input()`, `print()`, `str`, `int`, `float`

### 📄 Day2_Conditionals.py
- Takes 3 numbers and compares:
  - If all are equal
  - If two are equal
  - Otherwise prints the max & min
- Used: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `max()`, `min()`, logical operators

## 📎 Certificates (to be added)
