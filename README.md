# Embedded-Learn-Journey

📅 April 14 – May 24, 2025

This repository is a complete archive of my 41-day Embedded Systems and IoT development journey.  
The journey includes Python basics, logic design, C programming, Arduino, UART, GUI, and ESP32-based IoT projects.

## 📘 Daily Progress Log

- ✅ **Day 1** – Python Intro: `print()`, `input()`, data types  
- ✅ **Day 2** – Conditionals: age check, equality logic  
- ✅ **Day 3** – Loops + try/except: min/max finder  
- ✅ **Day 4** – Functions: Age classifier with input validation  
- ✅ **Day 5** – Python Certificate earned (Coursera – UMich)

## 💻 Projects

### 📄 Day1_PythonBasics.py  
Simple input/output, type conversion, and variable usage.  
Used: `print()`, `input()`, `int()`, `float()`

### 📄 Day2_Conditionals.py  
Compares 3 numbers, prints if all/two are equal, and shows the biggest/smallest.  
Used: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `max()`, `min()`

### 📄 Day3_Loops_CompareNumbers.py  
User enters numbers until `"done"`.  
Program returns the max/min values and handles non-numeric input.  
Used: `while`, `try/except`, `int()`, `break`, `continue`

### 📄 Day4_Functions_Strings.py  
Asks user's age and classifies them (child, teen, adult, senior).  
Shows function definition and `return` usage with input error handling.  
Used: `def`, `return`, `int()`, `try/except`, `if/elif/else`

## ⚙️ Day 7 – FSM Controlled LED Brightness (Arduino)

This milestone marks the completion of my first **FSM (Finite State Machine)** driven hardware logic.  
The system adjusts LED brightness using a push button and PWM outputs.

### 🔧 Features:
- LED brightness transitions: **Low → Medium → High**
- Controlled via FSM logic using a single button
- Implemented with `switch-case`, `analogWrite()`, and `INPUT_PULLUP`
- Debounce logic included for stable button input

### 🧠 Skills Gained:
- FSM fundamentals and state transitions
- PWM signal understanding via `analogWrite()`
- Hardware-level input handling with pull-up configuration
- Structuring clean, readable embedded code
