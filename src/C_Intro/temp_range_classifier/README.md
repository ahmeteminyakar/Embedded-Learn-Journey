# 🌡️ Temp Range Classifier – C Project

This program prompts the user to input **3 temperature values** and classifies each reading based on its range:

- ❄️ **FREEZING**: temperature < 0°C  
- 🌤 **NORMAL**: temperature between 0°C and 30°C  
- 🔥 **OVERHEAT**: temperature > 30°C  

If **2 or more readings are OVERHEAT**, the system prints a warning:  
> ⚠️ ENVIRONMENT UNSTABLE

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- `scanf()` input validation
- Multi-branch `if`/`else` conditionals
- Float comparisons and thresholds
- Counter logic (`overheatCount`)
- Looping through arrays

## 💻 Example Output

Enter Temperature 1: -5
❄️ FREEZING
Enter Temperature 2: 29.8
🌤 NORMAL
Enter Temperature 3: 41
🔥 OVERHEAT!
⚠️ ENVIRONMENT UNSTABLE!
