# ðŸ§  C_Pointer_Math

This folder contains progressive exercises, explanations, and experiments focused on pointer arithmetic, memory access, and array interactions in C. The goal is to master memory-level thinking, dereferencing logic, and pointer-based manipulationâ€”crucial for embedded systems.

## ðŸ“… Study Session: June 2â€“3, 2025

### âœ… Topics Covered
- Pointer declaration and dereferencing
- Pointer arithmetic
- Array-pointer relationship
- Address calculation and memory delta
- Typecasting pointers (e.g., `int*` â†” `char*`)
- Memory aliasing (`int**` and indirect access)
- Function-based pointer manipulation (`void write_register(...)`)
- Memory layout inspection with `%p` and `%ld`
- Byte-level modification of multi-byte integers

## ðŸ”§ Key Functions

### `void write_register(int* base, int offset, int value);`
> Abstracted memory manipulation function to simulate hardware register writes.

```c
write_register(regs, 2, 0xABCD1234);


*(base + offset)
Core pattern used for offset-based memory access, simulating register maps.
```c
ðŸ§  Core Learnings
int* ptr = &val; â†’ Points to variableâ€™s address

*(ptr + i) â†’ Access i-th offset in memory, assuming element type size

(char*)ptr â†’ Cast to byte-wise pointer to analyze or modify data

Pointer arithmetic is scaled by type size

int** (double pointers) allow layered memory abstraction (important for RTOS and drivers)

%p â†’ Pointer (memory address), (void*) cast is required

%x or %X â†’ Hexadecimal representation of values

%ld â†’ Signed long decimal, used for pointer distance in bytes
