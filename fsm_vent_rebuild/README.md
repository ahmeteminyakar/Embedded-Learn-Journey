# üå¨Ô∏è FSM Ventilation Control System ‚Äì Arduino + DHT11

This project implements a Finite State Machine (FSM) to control a ventilation system based on temperature readings from a DHT11 sensor. It uses non-blocking logic (`millis()`) to manage state transitions, a blinking LED indicator, and an audible buzzer alert when critical conditions are met.

## üß† System Overview

The system cycles through three operational states based on real-time temperature values:

| State         | Condition                               | Action                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `IDLE`        | Temperature < 28¬∞C                       | LED OFF, Buzzer OFF          |
| `VENT_WAIT`   | Temp ‚â• 28¬∞C (entry), Temp < 26 = reset   | LED blinks every 200ms       |
| `VENT_ACTIVE` | Temp ‚â• 28¬∞C for 10s continuously         | LED ON, Buzzer ON            |

All transitions are time- and condition-based using `millis()`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

| Component   | Qty | Pin     |
|-------------|-----|----------|
| DHT11 Sensor| 1   | D2       |
| LED         | 1   | D9       |
| Buzzer      | 1   | D10      |
| Arduino UNO | 1   | ‚Äî        |
| Resistors   | 2   | For LED/Buzzer if needed |

## üïí Timing Behavior

- `millis()` tracks elapsed time since entry to `VENT_WAIT`
- If 10s pass and temp ‚â• 28¬∞C ‚Üí activate ventilation
- LED blinks in `VENT_WAIT` to show system is "warming up"
- Buzzer is active only in `VENT_ACTIVE`
